## Noises

This directory is meant to house any clips that contain sound, but not recognizable speech of any language.  Loud noises, conversations that can't be clearly discerned, sirens, bangs, cracks, coughs, and so on.  Use a metadata.csv file with the following format when uploading clips:

```
filename, short description of noise
```

While not every clip will have a description, it is helpful to know if targeting a certain type of noise when building models.
